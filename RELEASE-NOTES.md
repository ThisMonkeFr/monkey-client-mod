# Monkey Client 0.7.0 / mod 0.5.0

## Modules and the in-game menu

- Coordinates-only debug mode now cancels the rest of Minecraft's position group and shows XYZ only.
- Zoom scales the world, main hand, offhand and HUD together. Opacity remains unchanged.
- Toggle Sprint's creative-flight speed setting reaches 100.
- World Editor synchronizes render distance with native video settings in both directions.
- Container Preview defaults to previewing without Shift. Hold Alt + Left Control over a container to pin its read-only inventory preview and inspect item tooltips; the inspection key can be rebound. Keep both keys held while inspecting.
- Waypoints has exactly 20 Minecraft block-texture icons and a configurable manager key, M by default.
- MCPVP can show the selected kit or best kit tier. The best-across-tierlists option compares gamemodes from MCTiers, SubTiers and MCPVP.
- Vanilla is the default menu theme: gray inventory panels, native widgets, a compact module grid and side-by-side settings/preview. Custom styling and launcher accent matching remain available.
- Hold Right Shift for 0.3 seconds for the animated landing menu. Promotional slogans and the hold-time footer are removed.
- The Mod Profiles tab supports create, apply, save, copy, rename, delete, and clipboard import/export.

## Launcher and profiles

- Vanilla-styled controls, square panels, and Minecraft font by default. Explicit existing font choices are preserved.
- Backgrounds extend behind the whole content area, including the updates and troop panels, on every tab. All animated effects follow the selected or custom accent.
- Frozen Glass has etched cracks, edge frost and moving light; Rift Lattice replaces Digital DNA; Cloudscape uses voxel clouds, stepped terrain, trees and a square sun.
- Update-panel text and its footer now flow without overlap, including at the minimum 1000×680 window size.
- New profiles copy options.txt, optionsof.txt, optionsshaders.txt, Iris/Oculus/shader properties, resource packs and shader packs from the selected profile. Originals remain in place; existing destination files are preserved. Close a running source instance first so its latest options are saved.
- Profile Settings → Installation → Change version checks every installed JAR, including manually added files. Matching mods and required dependencies update together. Only unavailable/unidentified mods appear in the shared Disable/Delete dialog, with per-mod choices and Disable all/Delete all.
- Version changes stage downloads, verify hashes, back up the original mods/options/profile and roll back the mods directory if saving fails. Backups are in the profile's backups/version-change-* folder.
- The launcher chooses a Monkey Client JAR by exact Minecraft version and loader, verifies its SHA-256, and refuses to substitute another version's build. Bundled artifacts work when the release server is unavailable; first-time game/Fabric API installation still needs the network.

## Version matrix

| Minecraft | Java | Fabric Loader | Forge |
|---|---:|---|---|
| 26.3 | 25 | 0.19.5 | Not released upstream |
| 26.2 | 25 | 0.19.5 | 65.1.0 |
| 26.1.2 | 25 | 0.19.5 | 64.1.0 |
| 26.1.1 | 25 | 0.19.5 | 63.0.2 |
| 26.1 | 25 | 0.19.5 | 62.0.9 |
| 1.21.11 | 21 | 0.19.5 | 61.2.0 |
| 1.21.10 | 21 | 0.19.5 | 60.1.0 |
| 1.21.9 | 21 | 0.19.5 | 59.0.5 |

All eight Fabric combinations and seven available Forge combinations have separate Monkey Client 0.5.0 builds. The launcher also supports vanilla profiles; Minecraft cannot load a mod without a mod loader.

Fabric builds bundle the corresponding Sodium renderer. There is no official Sodium Forge artifact for these versions, so Forge uses Minecraft's native renderer and its 32-chunk render-distance limit. Extended terrain caching/rendering to 1000 chunks remains a Fabric/Sodium feature.

## Verification and limits

- All 15 combinations compile to the required Java version and pass native class/method/field/injection-site audits. The three 1.21.x Fabric JARs also pass audits after remapping to runtime intermediary names.
- 193 mod regression checks and 322 additional native/cache/resource checks pass against 26.2.
- 41 launcher tests pass, including exact-build selection, artifact corruption, profile inheritance, local-mod compatibility, migration failure recovery, account persistence and model rendering.
- Forge's official installers completed for all seven supported versions, and the Forge mod audits use their patched game classes.
- The distributed fresh-download source build script was executed successfully for 26.2 Fabric.
- Launcher layout, font, theme effects, full-content background, profile creation and version controls were checked in a browser, including the minimum window size. No browser console errors were observed.

A live Minecraft world/GPU session has not been validated in this environment. Shader-pack and third-party mod combinations still need in-game testing. Container inspection is read-only and only displays contents the client has received. Custom capes remain local cosmetics. Back up important worlds before opening them in another Minecraft version; mod migration does not convert world saves.

Install the new launcher using Monkey Client Setup 0.7.0.exe. It bundles all 15 mod builds. Previous release deliverables were retained.
